THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM ASTLEY



(this is a fun prank site and not meant to cause damage to anyones computers, im fine with other types of prank making like, replacing rickrolls with gnome, stickbug, and distracted, but if it causes malware, its not ok, if you find a malware clone then dm me on discord at @RavenyXD#8175 and will request a takedown of these forks. One more thing, if you or your friend youre pranking has popup block on, it doesnt work)

HOW TO USE:
simply open https://raventhecrabraver.github.io/noescapefromastley.html on your friends computer on a new tab (supports any browser i think, maybe not on tv or console browers) and it will open a rick roll page, that if you click off of, it immediately pops back up. if you close it it just reopens. This continues infinitely.
HOW TO DISABLE:
simply close the tab that has noescapefromastley.html (CTRL + W on chrome, and i dont know how on others) open and the program stops until the page is reopened.
(NOTE THAT IF POP UP BLOCKER IS ENABLED IT WONT WORK)
And this obviously doesnt work on school computers that have youtube blocked. You know why.
